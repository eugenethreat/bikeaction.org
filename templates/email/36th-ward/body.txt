Hello {{ first_name }},

PBA organizers in Point Breeze are looking for involved neighbors to run for committeeperson (“CP”) in the 36th Ward (see boundaries below).

</div>

Why run? With enough CPs, we can ask 36th Ward Leader and Council President Kenyatta Johnson to pursue infrastructure changes like bike lanes, daylighting, and traffic calming. 

**Please reply to this email by Sunday, Feb. 1 to indicate your interest.** The responses we receive will determine our next steps (zoom call, coffee chat, something else). **No commitment is necessary at this time.** 

We can answer any questions you may have about running for and serving as a CP. In the meantime, this [handbook](https://seventy.org/uploads/attachments/ckz761n1l2lkl5onp30pivvui-how-to-run-for-committee-person-handbook-last-updated-01-24-22.pdf) from the good government group Committee of 70 may be helpful. 

Thanks for being a supporter, and stay warm\!
